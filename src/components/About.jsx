          <p>Aesthetic, productive, energetic, comfortable, functional, successful – are these the words you want your office to be associated with? Trust BlueMasons to do the job for you.</p>
          <p>Modern office interior design has come a long way from those days when uninspired and conventional cubicles ruled the scene. Today, employees need a well-planned and intelligently designed space where they can think, ideate, be productive, communicate, collaborate, and even relax and be happy. And since every business has a unique need, there’s no reason why your office should be like everyone else’s.</p>
          <p>So, as leading office interior designers in Kolkata, what do we do at BlueMasons? We take time to understand your industry, nature of business, operations or processes, workforce size and needs, your business objectives, your budget, and your preferences. We then come up with a workspace design idea that reflects your company’s mission, vision, values and culture.</p>
          <p>The modern office interiors we conceptualise and execute enable easy communication, offer tons of functionality and breathing room, and are fabulous to look at. BlueMasons takes a lot of care while choosing materials, textures, colours and patterns to create an environment that sparks creativity, positive vibes, efficiency, and makes a lasting impression on your clients.</p>
          <p>Things that we focus on as forward-thinking office interior designers
            Enough space – Too many employees thrown together or workstations that hardly have any distance between them can make your office noisy, full of distraction, claustrophobic, and lower overall productivity levels. Which is why, we always make sure that the office is spacious and there is enough room for everyone to focus, keep calm and feel at ease. </p>
          <p><strong>Natural elements –</strong> If your office receives ample sunlight and fresh air, it can boost employee mood and efficiency in a jiffy. But even if your office is mostly closed, we know how to use natural elements like greenery, wooden surfaces, and textiles like cotton or jute to freshen up the ambiance. We can also get creative with clear glass and mirrors for a bright, open and airy feel. </p>
          <p><strong>Super functional layouts –</strong> Whether you are looking for luxury office interior design or something that is more modest, we make sure that the layout offers maximum functionality by easing movement, communication, supervision, and team huddles. We design workspaces that are neither restrictive nor distracting. For instance, we design your office in such a way that you can have private meetings, casual chats, conferences and go about your everyday work with equal ease. </p>
          <p><strong>Comfort and relaxation –</strong> Unlike machines, human beings need breaks, a place to collect their thoughts, and regain lost energy. And that is what inspires BlueMasons, a new-age office interior design company, to bring in stylish yet ergonomic furniture that keeps your employees comfortable for long hours. We can also lend a fun and cheerful vibe to break rooms, cafeterias or hangout spaces, with beanbags, fancy lights, playful paintings, plants and bookshelves. If your office has the space, we can put together a workout or yoga corner as well!</p>
          <p><strong>Colours that inspire –</strong> A stark white office might look super clean (especially if you are in the healthcare business), but the right splash of bold or bright hues can liven things up. Some shades induce lethargy or sadness, while others are known to motivate employees and fire up their grey cells. Luckily, we know which ones to use and how, so that your office looks welcoming, happy and hopeful. We also know how to use artworks, sculptures and indoor greens to get the effect you want. </p>
          <p><strong>Technological prowess –</strong> The best office interior designs know how to incorporate technology seamlessly and where. Which is why, we make sure everything runs smoothly, from security devices, computers and projectors to modems, routers, cables, and telephone systems. Whether you need central air-conditioning or heating or want to control the lights and other appliances with your smartphone, we can handle it all.</p>
